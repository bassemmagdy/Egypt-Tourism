<p><h2> <br> Most people think that there are only three pyramids in Egypt. <br><br> What they don't know is that there are hundreds of pyrmaids. <br><br>The Pharaohs built these pyramids to be their graves and they <br><br> put all  their jewelry and precious belongings with them because <br><br> they believed in  life after death. They also built temples to show their <br><br> power and wealth.</h2></p>
